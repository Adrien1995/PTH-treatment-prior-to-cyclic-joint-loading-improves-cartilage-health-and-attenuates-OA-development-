Abstract 
Osteoarthritis (OA) treatment is limited by the lack of effective non-surgical interventions to slow disease progression and the inability to diagnose early-stage disease before structural damage becomes irreversible. We determined the contributions of the subchondral bone properties to OA initiation and progression. Specifically, we used parathyroid hormone (PTH) to modulate bone mass prior to OA initiation and alendronate (ALN) to inhibit bone remodeling during OA progression. In addition, we examined tissue crosstalk in the spatiotemporal progression of joint damage by combining histopathological and transcriptomic analyses across joint tissues collected at different time-points. The additive effect of PTH pretreatment prior to OA initiation and ALN treatment during OA progression most effectively attenuated load-induced OA pathology across the whole joint. PTH pretreatment directly improved cartilage health and slowed the development of cartilage damage, whereas ALN treatment primarily attenuated subchondral bone changes associated with OA progression. Early transcriptomic changes reflected subsequent structural damage, and the structural changes observed with both PTH pretreatment and ALN treatment were associated with modulation of immune responses in the joint. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of subchondral bone-modifying therapies to slow the progression of OA. Our findings suggest that immune responses that occur early after disease initiation can define disease mechanisms and identify signs of OA prior to overt structural damage.
